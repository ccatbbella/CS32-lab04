# CS32-lab04
### In this lab, WordCount.h, tddFuncs.h, and tddfuncs.cpp files are already provided. I implemented the functions in WordCount.cpp except the default constructor for the hash table, and the hash function. I also wrote the makefile, and the test file. Implementation of my WordCount.cpp function is tested with ASSERT_EQUAL and ASSERT_TRUE provided by tddfuncs.
